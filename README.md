Software Engineering course project - 2022

This is the final version of the project related to the Software Engineering class at Politecnico di Torino, a.y. 2021-2022.
The project was made by a group of students composed by:
- me (Mario Mastrandrea)
- Kristi Gjerko
- Samuele Lo Truglio

It is about a web app software able to manage a warehouse, allowing managers and workers to locate items, checking their quantity and other information, manage external orders and respective suppliers, and managing also internal orders made by internal organisational units in the company itself.

The application is mainly composed by a backend part, implemented in node.js+express; and a front-end (provided by the instructors) in React. But the attention was paid especially to the entire software engineering process, starting from the requirements up to the final implementation.
We adopted the waterfall model, as it was the scope of the course. 
So this project contains: 
- requirements documents
- examples of GUI interfaces
- design documents
- code (frontend + backend)
- test cases
  - module tests
  - API tests
- code derived by a change request from the (ideal) customer
